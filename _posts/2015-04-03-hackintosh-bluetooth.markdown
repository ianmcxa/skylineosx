Finding a compatible bluetooth adapter for your hackintosh can be rather complicated. This guide should help you select one. All these adapters support bluetooth 4.0 and should work in OSX Mountain Lion or above.
#USB Adapters
USB bluetooth adapters are probably the easiest to get working. The adapters here should be plug and play. 
##[IOGEAR GBU521](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B007GFX0PY/sk0fc-20)
[![](/images/guide-images/bluetooth1.png)](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B007GFX0PY/sk0fc-20)

This little adapter works out of the box with OSX 10.8+. It is very cheap and very reliable.

##[ORICO BTA-402](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B00AKO7XOW/sk0fc-20)

The BTA-402 is widely used and has been confirmed to work by many users on the insanelymac forum. 

##[Medialink USB 4.0](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B004LNXO28/sk0fc-20)
[![](/images/guide-images/bluetooth3.png)](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B004LNXO28/sk0fc-20)

This adapter should also work out of the box on 10.8+. It is not as widely used in the hackintosh community, but it uses a supported chipset, and is reported to work fine.

#PCI Adapters
If you want to make your hack look a little cleaner, or if you are using a laptop, you can use a PCI adapter to get bluetooth on your hackintosh.
##[AzureWave Broadcom BCM94352HMB](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B00JY6X9HM/sk0fc-20)
[![](/images/guide-images/bluetooth4.png)](https://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B00JY6X9HM/sk0fc-20)

This mini-PCIe card handles Wifi and Bluetooth. Wifi should work out of the box, however you will need [this kext](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-brcmpatchram/downloads) to enable bluetooth.

In the interest of full disclosure I should mention that the links here are amazon affiliate links meaning that I earn a %4 commission on any items purchased from these links. Also as a disclaimer, I have not personally tested any of these cards.
