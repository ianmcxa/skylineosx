I recently discovered a tool created by the Insanelymac member pokenguyen for easy post installation on a Hackintosh. The tool is called Hackintosh Vietnam, and it contains a lot of the same features as Tonymac's Multibeast; however, it is more inclusive and feature rich. This means that it can be useful across a wider range of systems.

Hackintosh Vietnam contains tools for installing and configuring Chameleon and configuring Clover. It comes with many commonly used kexts and patches.

You can download [Hackintosh Vietnam from osx86 here](http://www.osx86.net/files/file/3842-hackintosh-vietnam-ultimate-aio-tool/).

Or check out the [main thread here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/296669-hackintosh-vietnam-ultimate-aio-tool-for-hackintosh/).
