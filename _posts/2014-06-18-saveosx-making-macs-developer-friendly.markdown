[Save OS X](http://www.saveosx.org) is a project designed to implement a lot of the more developer friendly BSD and linux functionallity on Mac OS X. Most notably they have implemented a sort of coexistance between X11 applications designed for BSD and linux and Aqua based or OS X applications. This means that you can use a linux window manager on your mac. They have also created an extensive package repository of both source and binary packages, which can be downloaded through the pkgsrc and pkgin package manager.

If you are a developer or simply want a more powerful OS X desktop, I highly recommend that you check out their work at [www.saveosx.org](http://saveosx.org).
