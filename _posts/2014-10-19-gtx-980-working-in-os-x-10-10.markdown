The Maxwell based GTX 980 appears to be working in OS X 10.10 Yosemite with the Nvidia web driver. The driver has been buggy with Maxwell cards during the developer previews of Yosemite, so it's a little to early to tell if it'll be completely solid. The good news is that all Maxwell cards should now work with OS X.

[Download Yosemite Web Driver](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/78853/en-us)

For more detailed install instructions check out rampage dev's [web driver install guide](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/288582-new-nvidia-retail-driver-install-solution/). Note: the drivers he links are the old ones for Mavericks.
