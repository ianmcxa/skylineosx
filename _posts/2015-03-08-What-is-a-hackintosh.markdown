##What Is A Hackintosh?
A ‘hackintosh’ is basically a non-Apple branded computer running Apple’s operating system, OS X. Hackintoshes are generally far cheaper and more expandable than real macs. Because apple don’t use normal retail hardware like OEM producers such as HP or Dell, hackintoshes are more difficult to setup and to maintain than real macs. Most Hackintoshes are desktops assembled from a group of components that are known to work with OS X. It is possible to use a prebuilt desktop or laptop, but they are generally more difficult and less stable.

##Is it legal?
Sort of. Installing OS X on non Apple hardware is a violation of the EULA (End User License Agreement), but the general rule is unless you’re a business selling hackintoshes, Apple doesn’t care. Apple knows we exist and have had plenty of opportunities to stop us, but they have never so much as tried.

##Are Hackintoshes Stable?
It depends on the machine, and the install. If you’ve built a machine specifically for hackintoshing, generally you can get it to function as good as a real mac. On the other hand, hackintoshes are completely unsupported. You’ll have to be your own tech support, but don’t be nervous; there are a ton of great online resources and you can learn pretty much everything you need by reading.

##Can my Computer Run OS X?
That depends. The main qualifier is that your machine has an Intel processor. You can run on AMD, but it’s generally more trouble than it’s worth. The easiest machines to install on are ones with UEFI bios, especially Gigabyte boards. For the graphics card, Nvidia used to be easier to get working, but with the introduction of the 7xx series cards from Nvidia and the R9 2XX cards from AMD, the cards now work OOB(out of the box) and there is much less hassle required to get good graphics functionality.

To see if others have had success with your hardware check out: [the OSX86 wiki](http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

##I Want to Install OS X Where do I start?
Check out [Terms and Definitions](/terms-and-definitions.html), then begin with the [Installation Guide](/create-your-installer).

##I’ve seen easier looking guides out there; why follow this one?
The advantage to my guides are that they are completely manual. If anything goes wrong, you’ll know exactly where, and hopefully exactly why. This makes things a lot easier to fix. Moreover, my guides use the Clover bootloader which is lightyears ahead of it’s competition, and works on a wider range of hardware.

## What do I do if something goes wrong?
Research. Look to see if anyone else has had a similar problem. If you can’t find anything, post a question with the details of what went wrong.
