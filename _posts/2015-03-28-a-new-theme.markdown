You may have noticed that SkylineOSX looks completely different. We are no longer using wordpress I have recoded the site entirely using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

#Why the change?

Wordpress is slow. It's a giant PHP application that I was really only using to render out a few basic HTML webpages. Jekyll handles all the page rendering on my machine and then the Skyline webserver only has to deal with sending you the simple HTML pages. Also the design of the old site was kinda crummy. The favicon was 3MB, which should make any of you with web experience cringe.

Now that the site is completely static it should be safe from web exploits which actually took us down a while back.

#No More Ads

I think I earned about $12 total from Ads in the past 6 months. That really isn't worth lowering the quality of the site. Currently the funding for Skyline is coming from Amazon affiliate links. It's more than enough to pay for the server and domain, and I have a little left over, which is always nice when you're a college student.

#Open Source

If you look at the footer of the site you'll see this little image

What this means is that SkylineOSX is now licensed under Creative Commons meaning you are free to take any content from this site and use it anywhere so long as you attribute the work back to me and don't use it to make money. 

You can even take a look at the code for the site on [github](https://github.com/ianmcxa/skylineosx)

#What's next

I do plan to be more active on here especially in the Summer. The hackintosh world has been kinda quite for the past few months, but I expect we'll get some cool stuff pretty soon.

Anyway, thanks for reading this and good hacking.
