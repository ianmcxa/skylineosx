Every hackintosher has questioned the amount of time they've put into creating their perfect hybrid monster machine. All the way from the amount of time required to choose the parts and assemble to maintaining the machine and resolving kernel panics. The learning curve is what keeps some people away from installing OS X on their PCs in the first place. However, now, if you're not from the US, you can purchase a PC with OS X pre-installed.

Yup, it turns out that distributing computers with OS X pre-installed is only illegal in the US of A. European law has it that the installation has to be witnessed pre-purchase in order for the portions covered by the Apple EULA to be valid and when you're making the purchase from a company, which even installs OS X for you, you're not doing anything illegal.

One of the companies that do that is PearC. They package OS X Mountain Lion with a few of their PCs and they even ship with a Mountain Lion install USB, just in case anything goes wrong. "This is awesome, but what about updating to Mavericks and any other versions?" you ask. Well, PearC provides system patches free of charge and they advise their buyers about every single update. Patches are also released in the form of a package installer to allow hassle-free patching.

The current systems might not be the most up to date comparing them to the current Mac Pro, but it works out of the box!

Visit the PearC [Spanish](http://www.notatus.es) or [German](http://pearc.de) websites and check them out (Google Translate is your friend).
