I haven't been around much, so I figure I'd better fill you guys in on what's going on.

I started university this autumn. I'm at NC State getting a degree in CompSci. It's just taken a lot of my time, and my living conditions aren't exactly stable. I'm also working on a few other projects and I'm in the process of getting a part time development job. With all of that, I haven't had much time for Skyline. I'll probably pick it back up next semester when I get a decent place to work.
